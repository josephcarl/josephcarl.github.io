      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally took the plunge and am attempting blogging. Specifically, as this site is directly connected to my Github, it seems like a great place to showcase some of my projects and write about my experiences as I learn data analytics. Stack Overflow and numerous blogs have come to my aid as I have been learning R and Python over the last several months, so I hope I can use this blog to share some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned as well. Plus, I have never built a website before, so this is also a great learning opportunity. I may also write about some topics not directly related to data analytics as time goes on. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site was created with the &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; R package, RStudio, &lt;code&gt;Hugo&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; helpful how-to guide. I am using the two-repository method described in the post. Unfortunately, I could not get my computer to recognize the &lt;code&gt;josephcarl.github.io&lt;/code&gt; folder via the &lt;code&gt;publishDir&lt;/code&gt; option in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file, as described in the tutorial. I had to manually copy my files to that folder as a workaround, then commit the &lt;code&gt;josephcarl.github.io&lt;/code&gt; folder to its repo. Thankfully that doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too much work, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to find a better workaround soon. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a work in progress, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get started!&lt;/p&gt;
